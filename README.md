# Flux HQ Interactive Floor Map

Hack day project

AIMS:

1 - create web page with map

2- add link (when hover) for more info about rooms

2 - make interactive with hovering over rooms and seeing if booked or not

4 - add in hover sections to where teams are

5 - ???

###### NOTE: Jordane is also working on something similar and Sam is making a better SVG for him. Look to use this new svg in the future and integrate with what Jordane is doing.

This project was very exciting to me becuse I really wanted to work with SVGs. I found when using the vector image it was easier to write code to manipulate the image. We also wanted to add a level of user engagment with mouse over. I tried working with our CSS to create a color change when the mouse hovered over a meeting room. I think this would be a usful feature to add later. As a team I believe we hit our MVP maybe next time we can try for our stretch goals. 

It was great to work in a group with Libby and Priya, we all had diffiernt back grounds. The collboration and conversation around the issues and code challenge resulted in really positive outcomes. I liked engaging with code again, I hadn't in awhile. This was a large review for me with the jovascript language. I hope to continue the project and create a finished polished product.
